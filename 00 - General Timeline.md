# ARENA
- Disembodied voice comes from nowhere

- Crowd hears screeching, scratching, howling, and all manner of unpleasant noises coming from the four doors of the arena
- "...and then I'll find what I'm looking for amoung what's left. *maniacal laugh*. Slaughter them!"
- The four doors of the arena open and all manner of skeletal beings pour into the arena and massacre anything with more flesh then they have

# ARENA BATTLE
- PCs must fight to survive through a massive battle
- The festival had attracted all types of people, including mercenaries, wizards, clerics, and thieves
- Not to mention the guards that were on security detail
- So the battle is pretty even for a little while
- Last in each door is a fire-breathing T-Rex skeleton
- PCs can fight them, or try to escape
- A lot of the crowd escapes into the doors after the T-Rexs come out
- PCs eventually make their way through one of the doors

# TOWER
- Through the doors is a small dungeon crawl that leads to the uppermost chamber of the tower
- PCs will encounter at least one group of monsters and a few puzzles and traps before reaching the top of the tower

# BOSS CHAMBER
- PCs encounter the boss of this story
- A lesser demon with dreams of harnessing the power of a magical artifact in order to overthrow his master and become lord of this section of this plane
- The artifact is a set of twin rings that grant a user great magical power
- PCs can either convince the bride and groom to hand over their wedding rings or fight the demon
- Whatever the case, the demon lord will show up before the lesser demon can be killed or is on the verge of winning
- He reduces the lesser demon to a smoldering crater and apologizes to the party
- He then transports them all back to the festival, safe and resurrected

The PCs have fought their way up to the top of the tower
They come face-to-face with a demon who is holding the groom hostage
The demon's name is Quaris
The groom is still alive, but is chained to the wall
Quaris is sitting in a large chair far too big for it. It is clear that he has been enjoying the oppulence of this room/castle.

Quaris is holding the groom's wedding ring
"Greetings, mongrels. I had expected you to die in the arena, but now that you've brought this one's twin to me..."
Quaris uses the ring he is holding to indicate the ring the bride is wearing. Both rings glow a soft white.
"...you have saved me the trouble of searching through the mess downstairs for it."
"Now then, I don't suppose you'd just give me the ring, would you? If you do, I'll return what's left of your friend here."
The PCs can either give the demon the ring, or refuse
If they refuse, Quaris will try to take the ring by force
If they accept, Quaris will take the rings and try to kill the party anyway

# FIGHT
Just before the final blow is struck (no matter which side), the Quaris's master shows up
If Quaris had obtained the rings, he will try to use them against his master
But he will have already used them during the battle, so they will fizzle a little and not work
Quaris's master will cast him away. He will disappear, leaving the rings (if he had them) to clatter to the floor
Then, Quaris's master, Valdros, will appear to the players

Valdros will apologize to the PCs for his subordinate's behavior
He will heal the party's wounds, and release the groom
He will warn them to get rid of the rings, for they will only attack more power-hungry forces of darkness
He will then transport the party back to the festival, along with the crowd
All who died in the arena will be resurrected
And the party can enjoy the rest of the festival

THE END

# RING DETAIL
- Pure Concentric Rings
- Used by the wedding couple as silver engagement rings
- Glow softly and give off small amounts of power when in close proximity to each other
- They have a notch that allows them to fit inside each other
- If they are observed normally, they appear to be simple Rings of Light
- If they are united, and the magic word is spoken, they reveal their true nature and bestow a great amount of power to the user
- Mages using the rings can apply any/all of the following affects to any single spell once per week
	- Enlarge Spell - Double the range of a spell
	- Extend Spell - Double the duration of a spell
	- Maximize Spell - All variable, numeric effects of a spell (dice rolls) are automatically considered to be their maximum value
	- Widen Spell - Double the affected area of a spell
- Use of the rings does not increase the spell slot level the spell uses up, as it would if the feats were used normally

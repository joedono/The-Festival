They encounter several obstacles

# OBSTACLES

	- Through the door can be heard chattering and clicking
	- The door has a small sun carved into it, while the wall with the levers has a moon painted on it
	- All the levers are in the "down" position, and return there when left alone
	- The inscription above reads "Fifth from the left, then fourth from the right. But two must die to open the night"
	- Translation: Subtract 2 from the numbers in the first line to get 3rd from the left, then 2nd from the right
	- Solution: Flip the levers in the order 3, 2, 1 to open the door
	- Through the night door is a hallway that bends around the room on the other side, enabling the PCs to avoid the fight
	- Through the day door is a small army of skeleton monsters

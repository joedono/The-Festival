The whole crowd reappears inside a great arena
The groom is no where to be seen
The arena has four doors, one at each of the cardinal directions
Rather than sloping away from the arena and being composed of seats, the sections above the main wall of the arena slopes inward, forming a dome-shaped roof
A disembodied voice echos across the arena
"Greetings, pions of a lesser race. One of you has the other half of something I want. I was going to sift through you one-by-one, but that got boring. So I brought you all here. My little friends here will have themselves a massacre..."
At this point, the PCs and the crowd notice screeching, growling, scratching, howling, and all manner of monsterous noises coming from the doors
"...and then I'll find what I'm looking for amoung what's left. *maniacal laugh*. Slaughter them!"
The four doors of the arena open and all manner of skeletal beings pour into the arena and massacre anything with more flesh then they have

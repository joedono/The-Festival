Hail and well met, fellow adventurers! For all of you who don't know me, I'm Joe and I will be your DM for the Dungeons & Dragons portion of Sal and Danielle's "Jack and Jill Party" this weekend.

Basic Campaign Info:
Character Level: 10
Ruleset: 3.5e
Allowed books: Everything except Psionics
Starting Gold: 22,400gp (use to buy gear)
I will NOT be enforcing Carrying Capacity

Ability/Stat Generation:
Use the standard "roll 4d6 and drop the lowest number" to generate stats. You may roll your stats twice and pick the better set.

Campaign Intro:
Edgar and Sophie are hopelessly in love and engaged to be married. He is a reserved merchant and blacksmith of moderate success and she is a headstrong graduate of Karn's School of Wizardry. They have invited you to accompany them to the Festival of Lights in the country of Altago to celebrate their engagement on the night before they are to be wed. One part Japanese New Year's Celebration, one part Rennaissance Fair, and one part Carnival, the Festival of Lights is sure to be a great source of fun and entertainment. But a shadow watches the festival. A dark presence plots disaster for the Festival of Lights.

Character Background Notes:
The campaign setting is typical medival fantasy. All your characters must have some connection to Edgar and/or Sophie that would make it plausible for them to invite you to their pre-wedding party. Your character may have known Edgar since childhood, or may be best friends with another PC who went to school with Sophie. The point is, your PC does not have to know Edgar or Sophie directly, but there shouldn't be more than one degree of seperation between you and them. There won't be anyone other than PCs and the wedding couple in the initial party, so you should discuss any indirect connections to Edgar and/or Sophie with the other players. This will be a Good campaign. Edgar and Sophie are both upstanding members of society. You don't have to make a perfect, law-abiding citizen, but no serial killers or heartless demons please. O:)

Session Notes for Saturday:
Please bring a hard copy of your character sheet to the session. No laptops during gameplay. Although we will have extras, please bring your own dice if possible. I will bring my laptop with most/all of the 3.5 reference manuals in case we need to look something up. I encourage note-passing between DMs and players, so bring something to write with ;)

Special Note:
SAL DOESN'T KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING!!!
So, in the interest of keeping this session a surprise, but still short enough for one night, I'd like to ask that some of you roll up an additional character for Sal so that we don't have to ruin the surprise by having him roll up one before hand and we can keep the session short by not taking time to have him roll one up at the session on Saturday.

Final Notes:
Please have your character (and your entry for Sal's character) done and sent to me by Thursday night so I can get a feel for the party make-up and have a more concrete PC head count. I'm planning for 7 PCs at the moment. The easiest way to get me your character is to use the site below to build it, add it to the campaign (ID=183), and email me the URL for your character sheet. Registration is free and the builder does a lot of math for you. The site is fairly printer-friendly too.
